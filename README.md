Open Source Robotic Bartender

B.I.A.S.T. is a robotic bartender loosely based off the [Inebriator](http://www.theinebriator.com/) design. It is written in Python and uses the [Kivy](www.github.com/kivy/kivy) library to render the GUI.

B.I.A.S.T. is designed to be run on a touchscreen Raspberry Pi interfaced with an arduino to handle inputs and outputs.
